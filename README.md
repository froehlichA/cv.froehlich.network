## Development

This website was developed using the framework [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), a static site generator, which itself uses technologies such as [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/). GatsbyJS uses all the advantages of React, such as components and declarative views, while adding features only static sites can provide, like incredibly fast load times and an increased SEO.

The website is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), a static hosting provider that automatically manages deployment, continuous integration, and HTTPS.
